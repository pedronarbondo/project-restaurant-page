# project-restaurant-page

See it hosted live @ https://pedronarbondo.github.io/project-restaurant-page/

This project is designed to make us use webpack to implement modules to our website.
The idea is to be able to make the site "tab-responsive", meaning that instead of re-directing the user to new pages, every new page loads on the same main landing page.

An excellent project to implement the import and export statements, along with reusable functions.
